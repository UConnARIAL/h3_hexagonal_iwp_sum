Aggregating the IWPs across the arctic
Scripts and pipeline to create H3 Hexagonal Aggregation summary for IWPs

H3 is a global grid indexing system and library developed by Uber to facilitate spatial data analysis. 
The H3 system uses a hierarchical hexagonal grid to tessellate the Earth's surface, allowing for efficient 
indexing and querying of spatial data at multiple levels of detail.

**Step 1**
Download the geopackage data from the Arctic Data Center(ADC). You can use the following script given as an example.
Make sure you have sufficient space 

```wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R '\?C=' -R robots.txt https://arcticdata.io/data/10.18739/A2KW57K57/iwp_geopackage_high/WGS1984Quad/15/3776```

**Step 2**
Convert the geopackage (.gpkg) file to ArcGIS readable shapefile (efficient) compared to reading from ArcGIS
```ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" ./arc_3776 3776/*.gpkg```

[Script to do step 1 and 2 above](https://github.com/UConnARIAL/h3_hexagonal_iwp_sum/blob/main/get_gpkg_to_shp.sh)


**Step 3**
Run the [ArcPy Script](https://github.com/UConnARIAL/h3_hexagonal_iwp_sum/blob/main/h3_hexagonal_sum.py) for each (ex. 3776) batch of files
This script has to be executed on ArcGIS pro inside the app. When executed on commandline some files get locked and exection fails sometimes giving inacurate results.

**Step 4**
Combine the summary table (csv files for each batch) via a database join on the h3 Hex grid ID.
